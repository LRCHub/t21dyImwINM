I believe, I believe, I believe in love
Feel it once, feel it twice I can't get enough
Let you in, let you go, maybe not maybe so
See my first love was a while ago

I can be, I can be, I can be your all
I can be what you need when you hit a wall
You should know that I don't ever take it slow
See my first love was a while ago

Lights bright in the city
I don't, I don't want your pity
I can't tell you what you don't already
Know (I don't know why you're pretending)
Lights bright in the city
I don't, I don't want your pity
And I'll leave before you tell me not
To go (I don't know what I'm pretending)
(Not to go)

I can see, I can see, I can see you now
Never once in your life had to let me down
Wanna stay with you boy but I know how it goes
See my first love was a while ago

Lights bright in the city
I don't, I don't want your pity
I can't tell you what you don't already
Know (I don't know why you're pretending)
Lights bright in the city
I don't, I don't want your pity
And I'll leave before you tell me not
To go (I don't know what I'm pretending)

(Not to go)

I'm walking by your house
I keep on going to ya
I thought I told myself I'd walk away and never call ya
I'm walking by your house
I keep on thinking bout ya
And I keep hoping for the day that I will run into ya

Oooooh

Lights bright in the city
I don't, I don't want your pity
I can't tell you what you don't already
Know (I don't know why you're pretending)
Lights bright in the city
I don't, I don't want your pity
And I'll leave before you tell me not
To go (I don't know what I'm pretending)
